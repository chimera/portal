# Portal

Ruby on Rails application that controls access to [Chimera Art Space](http://chimeraarts.org).

The application reads RFID cards, authenticates it against a set of users and if valid, unlocks our doors.

Cards and users can be managed via a simple interface and metrics about activity are automatically generated for administrators.
